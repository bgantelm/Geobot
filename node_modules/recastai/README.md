```

From [github.com](https://github.com/):

```bash
npm install 'https://github.com/RecastAI/SDK-NodeJs.git'
```

## Usage

### Module

```javascript
import recast from 'recastai'

const CLIENT = new recast.Client(YOUR_TOKEN, YOUR_LANGUAGE)

CLIENT.textRequest(YOUR_TEXT, (res, err) => {
  if (err) {
    // Handle error
  } else if (response.intent() === YOUR_INTENT) {
    // Do your code...
  }
})
```

## Specs

### Classes

This module contains 5 main classes, as follows:

* Client is the client allowing you to make requests.
* Response contains the response from [Recast.AI](https://recast.ai).
* Sentence represents a sentence of the response.
* Entity represents an entity found by Recast.AI in your user's input.
* RecastError is the error returned by the module.

Don't hesitate to dive into the code, it's commented ;)

### class Client

The Recast.AI Client can be instanciated with a token (optional) and a language (optional), and provides the two following methods:

* textRequest(text, callback, options = {}) *Performs a text request*
* fileRequest(file, callback, options = {}) *Performs a voice file request*

On each call to `textRequest` or `fileRequest` you can override either your token or your language by passing a hash of options.

If no language is provided in the request, Recast.AI does the following:

* textRequest: the language of the text is detected and is used for processing if your bot has expressions for it, else your bot's primary language is used for processing.
* voiceRequest: your bot's primary language us used for processing as we do not provide language detection for speech.

If a language is provided, Recast.AI does the following:

* textRequest: the language you've given is used for processing if your bot has expressions for it, else your bot's primary language is used.
* voiceRequest: the language you've given is used for processing if your bot has expressions for it, else your bot's primary language is used

*Both callbacks should take two parameters: a Response and a RecastError*
*Accepted options are: token and language, to override the defaults provided at initialization*

```javascript
import recast from 'recastai'

// Create a new Client
const CLIENT = new recast.Client(YOUR_TOKEN, YOUR_LANGUAGE)

// Performs a text request on Recast.AI
CLIENT.textRequest('Hello, world', (res, err) => {
  // Do your code...
})

// Performs a voice file request on Recast.AI with the optional token
CLIENT.fileRequest('myfile.wav', (res, err) => {
  // Do your code
}, { token: ANOTHER_TOKEN })

// Performs a text request on Recast.AI with the optional language
CLIENT.textRequest('Hello, world', (res, err) => {
  // Do your code
}, { language: ANOTHER_LANGUAGE })
```

### class Response

The Recast.AI Response is generated after a call to one of the two previous methods and contains the following methods:
* sentence(\*)  *Returns the first detected sentence*
* get(name)     *Returns the first entity matching -name-*
* all(name)     *Returns all the entities matching -name-*
* intent(\*)    *Returns the first matched intent*

In addition, you can access each of these attributes:
* raw *The raw unparsed response*
* source *The source sentence Recast.AI processed*
* intents *All the matched intents*
* sentences *All the detected sentences*
* version *The version of the JSON*
* timestamp *The timestamp at the end of the processing*
* status *The status of the response*

```javascript
CLIENT.textRequest('Give me a recipe with asparagus. And tomatoes', (res, err) => {
    // Get the first sentence, aka 'Give me some recipe with asparagus'
    let firstSentence = response.sentence()

    // If the first intent matched is 'recipe'...
    if (response.intent() === 'recipe') {
      // ... get all the entities matching 'ingredient'
      let ingredients = response.all('ingredient')

      // ...
    }
    console.log(`This request has been filled at ${response.timestamp}`)
  })
```

### class Sentence

The Recast.AI Sentence is generated by the Recast.AI Response constructor and provides the following methods:
* get(name)     *Returns the first entity matching -name-*
* all(name)     *Returns all the entities matching -name-*

In addition, you can access each of these attributes:
* source *The source of the sentence*
* type *The type of the sentence*
* action *The action of the sentence*
* agent *The agent of the sentence*
* polarity *The polarity (negation or not) of the sentence*
* entities *All the entities detected in the sentence*

```javascript
CLIENT.textRequest('Tell me a joke.', (res, err) => {
    // Get the first sentence
    let sentence = response.sentence()

    if (sentence.action === 'tell' && sentence.polarity === 'positive') {
      // Tell a joke...
    }
  })
```

### class Entity

The Recast.AI Entity is generated by the Recast.AI Sentence constructor and provides the following attributes:

* name *The name of the entity*
* raw *The raw text on which the entity was detected*

In addition to this method, more attributes are generated depending of the nature of the entity, which can be one of the following:

* hex
* value
* deg
* formated
* lng
* lat
* unit
* code
* person
* number
* gender
* next
* grain
* order

```javascript
CLIENT.textRequest('What can I cook with salmon ?', (res, err) => {

    if (response.intent() === 'recipe') {
      // Get the ingredient
      let ingredient = response.get('ingredient')

      console.log('You asked me for a recipe with ${ingredient.value}')
      // 'You asked me for a recipe with salmon'
    }
  })
```

### class RecastError

The Recast.AI Error is thrown when receiving an non-200 response from Recast.AI.

As it inherits from Error, it implements the default Error methods.
